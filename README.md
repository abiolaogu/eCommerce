# FusionCommerce

FusionCommerce is a headless, API-first commerce platform that blends event-driven architecture, AI-driven decisioning, and modular microservices. This repository aggregates reference materials and documentation for the FusionCommerce blueprint.

- Review the [FusionCommerce Architecture Overview](docs/fusioncommerce-architecture.md) for a detailed breakdown of the platform layers and innovation models.
- Explore the accompanying PDFs, DOCX files, and diagrams in the repository root for visual schematics and extended narratives that complement the written overview.

These resources provide a foundation for implementing composable commerce solutions built around Kafka, n8n, and AI-driven services.
